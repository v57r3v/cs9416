EARTH 2 Lab   
Lab 2:	Plate	Tectonics
Purpose	of	the	lab:
• Walk	in	the	intellectual	footsteps	of	the	scientists	who	first	discovered	plate	tectonics
• Learn	about	relative	plate	motions	on	the	Earth
• Appreciate	various	aspects	of	oceanic	crustal	formation	at	mid-ocean	ridges
• Consider	the	pattern	of	volcanoes	and	earthquakes	at subduction	zones
• Use	hot	spot	tracks	to	clock	the	speed	of	the	plates
PART	1:	Apparent	polar	wander	– using	magnetic	Inclination
One	of	the	first	indications	that	the	Earth’s	surface	was	not	static	was	the	observation	that	the	magnetic poles,	as	measured	by	the	magnetic	fields	frozen	into	rocks,	appeared	to	move.	Of	course,	we	now	understand that	the	apparent	motion	is	in	fact	due	to	the	motions	of	the	plates	themselves.		This	question	will	illustrate how	we	can	use	these	data	to	map	the	motion	of	the	plates	through	time.
A.	What	is	the	difference	between	magnetic	inclination and	magnetic	declination?_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________	[3]
A simple	equation	relates	the	magnetic	field inclination	(I)	we	measure	at	the	surface	to	the latitude	(λ):
tan I = 2 tan   λ
Which	can	be	shown	in	graphical	form.	to	the left.
A.	 What	latitude are	we	at	here	in	Santa Barbara?_________________________________ [1]
B.		Using	the	equation	or	graph	above,	compute	the	inclination in	SB	today:		_________________________˚ 		[2]
C.		If	you	were	to	make	a	new	rock	in	Santa	Barbara	today,	freeze	in	the	inclination,	and	then	transport that	rock	(keeping	it	perfectly	horizontal	so	that	the	inclination	doesn’t	change!)	down	to	Oaxaca,	Mexico (Latitude	=	17˚),	by	how	much would	the	frozen-in	magnetic	inclination	deviate	from	the	local	measured inclination?___________________________________˚ [3]
D.	Consider	the	following	section	of	layered	rocks	recorded	on	a	small	tectonic	plate.	Each	layer	has	a measured	magnetic	inclination	and	age	indicated.	Assuming	you	know	the	path	taken	by	the	plate,	use	the inclination	and	age	data	to	compute	the	paleolatitudes	at	each	time	– record	your	answers	in	the	table provided and	draw	on	the	diagram when	the	plate	was	at	various	positions	along	its	path. [6]

Note	“Ma”	– literally	“Mega	annum”	– just	means “millions	of	years	ago”.
Also:	while	we	have	provided	the	plate	path	in	the	question	above,	in	real	paleomag. studies,	researchers	have	to	use	a	combination	of	magnetic declination	and	inclination	to	recreate	the	path.

PART	2:	Magnetic	stripes	and seafloor	spreading
The	observation	and	understanding	of	magnetic	stripes	on	the	seafloor	were key	to	our	understanding	of seafloor	spreading	and	the	motion	of	the	oceanic	plates.	These	measurements	provided	irrefutable	proof	of plate	tectonic	theory.	These	magnetic	isochrons	(“equal-time”	stripes)	allow	us	to	“unwind	the	tape”	and reconstruct	the	history	of	plate	motions.	This	phenomenon	arises	because	of	periodic	reversals	in	polarity	of the	Earth’s	magnetic	field.
A.		The	figure	below	shows	several	snapshots	of	the slow	opening	of	an	ocean	as	two	continents	separated over	the	last	4	million	years.	On	the	left	you	are	given	a	key	showing	the	(simplified)	magnetic	polarity history	for	the	last	4	Ma.	Using	this	key,	shade	in	the	seafloor at	each	age on	the	figure	to	indicate	the polarity of	seafloor	in	this	ocean. You	may	assume	constant	spreading	rate	through	time. [8]
NOTE:	new	crust	generated	in	one	time	step	should	show	up	in	all	subsequent	time	intervals…
NOTE	ALSO:	that	during	several	of	these	time	periods	there	are	polarity	reversals!!

B.	If	you	are	told	that	at	the	present	day,	the	two	continents	are	240	km	apart,	what	is	the	full	spreading rate of	this	mid-ocean	ridge,	in	km/million-years?________________________________	km/Myr			[2]
C.	What is	the	half-spreading	rate (the	rate	at	which	either	side	moves	away	from	the	ridge)?________________________________	km/Myr			[1]
D.	What	is	the	full	spreading	rate	in	units	of	mm/yr ?________________________________	mm/yr			[2]
Different	mid-ocean	ridges	spread	at	different	rates.	With	increasing	age,	the	oceanic	plates	progressively cool,	get	denser,	and	sit	lower	in	the	mantle	(think	about	a	fully	loaded	cargo	ship	versus	an	empty	cargo ship).	This	results	in	a	systematic,	predictable	relationship	between	plate	age	and	ocean	depth.
The	diagram below shows	the	relationship	between	ocean	depth	and	distance	from	the	mid-ocean	spreading ridge	for	two	different	oceans;	the	Atlantic (blue) and	the	Pacific (red).

E.	What	is	the	spreading	rate	for	each	ridge:
Pacific	seafloor	spreading	rate	is	________________________________	km/Ma			[3]
Atlantic	seafloor	spreading	rate	is	________________________________	Km/Ma			[3]
F.	Which	ridge	has	a	faster	spreading	rate?			[1]																		________________________________
G.	By	drawing	smooth	lines through	the	uneven	profiles,	estimate	the depth of	20	million-year-old seafloor	in	each	of	these	oceans:
Pacific	seafloor	aged	20	Ma	is	________________________________	m	depth			[3]
Atlantic	seafloor	aged	20	Ma	is	________________________________	m	depth			[3]
H.	How	do	these	two	estimated	depths	compare to	each	other?	How	do	you	explain this	answer?________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________	[3]
I.	The	inset	shows	a	close	up	of	the	axial	region	for	each	ridge. The	difference	in	spreading	rate	also affects	the	shape	of	the	axial	region.	What	is	the	difference	between	the	axial	region	for	slow	versus fast spread	crust?_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________代 写EARTH 2 Lab 2: Plate TectonicsR

PART 3:		Sea	Floor	spreading	– fracture zones	and	transform.	faults
The	observation	of	large	scars	in	the	seafloor	– fracture	zones – was	an	important	early indicator	that	the	oceans	were	mobile.	Later, these	features	were	recognized	as	crucial	to explaining	how	relatively	linear	plate boundaries	snake	over	the	surface	of	our curved	planet.	Tuzo	Wilson	showed	how	the pattern	of	ridges,	transforms,	and	fracture zones	all	made	sense	through	the	theory	of plate	tectonics.
Activity: Find	the	seafloor	spreading	model.	Make	the	sea	floor	spread by	pulling	the	wooden continents	apart.		Carefully	observe the	sea	floor	spreading	centers,	the	active	transform.	faults	and	the fracture	zones.		(By	definition,	the	fracture	zones	include	both	the	active	transform.	faults	and	the	inactive, fossil	traces	of	transform.	faults.)
Questions:
A.	As	sea	floor	spreading	widens	the	ocean,	do	the	spreading	center	segments	change	length?
(circle	one)				Yes				or				No [1]
B.	As	sea	floor	spreading	widens	the	ocean,	do	the	active	transform.	faults	change	length?
(circle	one)				Yes				or				No [1]
C.	As	sea	floor	spreading	widens	the	ocean,	do	the	fracture	zones	change	length?
(circle	one)				Yes				or				No [1]
D.	The	figure	to	the	right	is	a	map	of	a	spreading	system between	two	hypothetical	plates	A and	B,	with	three slightly	offset	spreading	centers	segments…

- Label each	active	spreading	center:		SC
- Label each	active	transform.	fault:		TF
- Label each	inactive	fracture	zone:		FZ
- Put	arrows on	the	two	sides	of	each	active	plate boundary	segment	showing	the	relative	motion	between the	two	sides	(i.e.,	five	pairs	of	arrows).    [8	total]
E.	The	green	star	shows	an	earthquake.	Would	we	expect	this	earthquake	to	involve	plates:
separating	apart	from	each	other						or					sliding	horizontally	past	each	other		 ?	(select	one)	[1]
F.	Consider	points	1	and	2	in	the	figure	above,	on	opposite	sides	of	the	dotted	line.	Is	the	oceanic	crust	at these	points:
the	same	age										or								 1	older	than	2 									or 							 2	older	than	1									?	(select	one) [1]
PART	4:	Plate	boundaries
The	most	tectonically	active	parts	of	the	planet	are	at	the	plate	boundaries – the	interfaces	between	one plate	and	another.	The	plates	are	– by	definition	– moving	with	respect	to	each	other	at	these	boundaries, which	creates	earthquakes,	volcanoes,	and	dramatic	topography.
The	following	questions	ask	you	to	analyze carefully	the	figure	of	the	South	America-Pacific	plate boundary on	the	next	page.	This	figure	contains	a	lot	of	information,	so	take	some	time	to	look	over	it	and ensure	you	understand	it.
A.	What	is	the	name for	this	type	of	plate	boundary?_________________________________________________	[1]
B.	What	is	the	relative	motion of	the	plates	across	this	boundary?_________________________________________________	[1]

Figure 1: Figure made using GeoMapApp software showing South America - Pacific plate boundary. Circles show locations of earthquakes since 1960, colored by depth and scaled by magnitude. The red stars are active volcanoes. A topographic profile across the plate boundary at ~30˚S is inset.
C.	What	is	the	overall	relationship between	the	depth	of	earthquakes	and	distance	from	the	plate boundary	here (i.e.,	from	the	trench	just	offshore	from	the	continental	margin)?	How	do	you	explain this trend?________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________	[3]
D.	What	is	the	approximate	distance between	the	volcanic	arc (the	chain	of	volcanoes,	marked	by	red stars)	and	the	plate	boundary?_________________________________________________	[1]
E.	Draw	a	cross	section that	spans	the	region	of	the topographic	inset at	30˚S	in	the	space below.	Show the	structure	of	the	plates	from	the	surface	down	to	200	km	depth	in the	Earth.	Make	sure	to	illustrate and	label the	slab,	trench,	Andes	mountains,	volcanoes,	and	earthquake	locations. [5]
F.	Explain what	leads	to	volcanism	in	the	Andes	(and	other	plate	boundaries	of	this	kind)._________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________	[3]
PART	5:	Hotspot	tracks
Hotspot	tracks	form.	as	plates	move	over	hot	plumes	from	the	Earth’s	deep	interior.	These	plumes	are thought	to	initiate	at	the	core-mantle	boundary	and	undergo	melting	as	they	rise	to	the	surface.	The	melted rock	then	punches	through	the	plate	above	the	hot	spot,	creating	volcanic	seamounts,	islands,	atolls	and guyots	(depending	on	the	amount	of	volcanism	and	age/maturity	of	the	volcanic	edifice). Hotspots	remain relatively	immobile	while	plates	move	over	them	and	can	therefore	be	used	to	work	out	the	speed	and direction	of	plate	motion.
The	following	questions	rely	on	interpretation	of	the	Hawaiian	ocean	island	chain	shown	in	the	following figure.	The	figure	gives	you	compass	directions	and	a	horizontal	scale,	in	km,	measured	along	the	chain from	the	youngest	ocean	island volcano	– Kilauea,	which	is	presently	active.	In	red	are	localities	of	rocks dated	using	geochronological	techniques.
NOTE,	one	of	the	ages is	actually wrong… so	be	careful!

A.	Using	this	hotspot	track,	calculate the	speed	of	the	plate’s	motion	over	the	Earth’s	surface,	in	mm/yr._______________________________	mm/yr	[5]
B.	Roughly	in which	compass	direction is	the	plate	moving? (we’re	looking	for	an	answer	like	“north”	or	“southeast”)_______________________________	[1]
C.	Which of	the	rock	ages is	wrong and	what should	the	age of	rocks	at	that	locality	actually	be (be	sure that	the	plate	speed	that	you	report	for	part	A	is	not	based	on	the	incorrect	point)?
The	age	of	________________	Ma	is	wrong	– rocks	on	that	island	should	be _______________________ Ma	[4]
